# 💫 Hi I'm Ugyen,

I like to call myself an AI/ML researcher and engineer fueled by curiosity and caffeine (recently obsessed with hand-beaten coffee). I’m passionate about turning raw data into stories and building intelligent systems that make a difference. My work lives at the crossroads of data science and engineering - designing pipelines and architectures that move data seamlessly to solve real-world problems. I mostly code in Python and modern full-stack environments like the MERN stack, but every now and then, I revisit the classics - PHP and Java - for their nostalgic elegance. Right now, I’m diving into TinyML optimization frameworks, pushing deep learning closer to the edge, and exploring how data itself can make places smarter, kinder, and happier. 

Outside of code, I’ve got a soft spot for poetry and I’m learning to make time for it(hardly manage to do so tho).
